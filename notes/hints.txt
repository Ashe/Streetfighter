I learned from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKZ7ML4_2lM 
- To see how animations were supposed to look and what frame rate they should be at (6 appears to be perfect)
- That crouching animations always played (1-frame delay before reset back to idle)
- (CORRECTED LATER) You had to do the 'crouching' part of the jump animation before you launched (1-frame delay before jump)
	- The jump animation has a wind up that crouches, and so it appears that you need to stay grounded for that frame otherwise the shadow will float in mid air
- That you cannot change the direction you're facing in mid air, even when you get behind your opponent

I used the blog 'Hitboxes and Hurtboxes' (https://www.developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/cc08d63b-2b7c-4dee-abb4-272b834d7c3a/gamemaker-basics-hitboxes-and-hurtboxes_
- For inspiration about how to set up collision boxes
- That the size and position of a hitbox can be more effective than high damage numbers

I actually emulated street fighter 2 to play the game myself:
- I learned that you can jump straight away without an animation delay (in the gameplay the player crouched a lot)
	- I previously thought that the crouch happened first, but the animation plays smoothly that you cannot tell
	- In the actual game, the shadow is disconnected from the player's sprite (not like the spritesheet I was working with)
	- This would make the corrected jump make more sense, as right now the shadow doesn't float in mid air for a split-second. It is hard to notice, but it does indeed come off the ground as it is now
- Jumping forwards or backwards perform flips, not standard jumps
- While you can collide with the other character you cannot land on top of them
- I found that there's a forced delay in between attacks, but with good timing you can go faster than if you spammed
- The game pauses for each connected attack for a few frames. This serves three things:
	- 1. It gives the player amazing feedback that their attack connected, visually showing the enemy being hit
	- 2. It feels rewarding to have cool attacks be showcased this way in front of your opponent, its fun
	- 3. It helps you understand what attacks are being used by both players and the distances / timings involved
- The flip-kick attack hits twice and must be done when in close proximity to the enemy
- The sprite sheet's 'forward middle kick (flip kick)' is incorrect and is missing the frame
	- The actual animation is actually the same as 'Jump High Kick'
	- The new forward_middle_kick is a combination of the two to keep the shadow on the floor for the ground portion
- The jumping and forward-jumping punch attacks end when the character lands, but the kicks end after the animation (but prevents you from attacking again)
- You cannot be attacked while knocked down or recovering
	- The attacks that do knock down the opponent (when not blocked) are the crouched-high-kick, jump-high-kick, the flip kick and the forward-high-kick (neck breaker) moves
- I worked out the damage numbers by using only that attack and counting how many moves it takes to kill the opponent
	- This reinforces the evidence of the light-medium-heavy approach to punches and kicks found by other sources
	- I couldn't find any other resources for damage numbers online (I imagine as its a lot of work)
	
From "Street Fighter 2 Oral History" (https://www.polygon.com/a/street-fighter-2-oral-history/chapter-2) I learned:
- They opened up the timing of combos to make it easier. They used an input-buffer system that stored inputs
	- In my version, I've opted for setting flags and changing the state based on these flags as I'm not planning on doing the combo moves
	- The combo moves require practice to pull off and for the prototype I don't think they are necessary for fun (I couldn't do them when playing emulator)
	- BUT, in order to pull off combo moves, I can check what states the character has been in, rather than inputs
	- This moves the responsibility of checking the timing of an input from the move-check to the state-check
		- as long as the states transitioned correctly then a combo would execute, spammed input or late input can be ignored easily making it easier for the player
- They emphisised Chun-Li's kicking abilities. I tried to make sure that the kicks really felt good by using my frame-pausing (discovered from emulator) to show off her strong kicks at point of contact

Reaction Speeds in Gaming (https://kayin.moe/?p=2047):
- I learned just about not only the different actions one can take in street-fighter but also the typical thoughts of players
	- The stomping points of good vs bad players appears to be the execution of special moves like fireballs and throws
		- I will not include these into the game as for new players its difficult to recognise how to counter these moves
			- It will also simplify the options the player has and make the game less intimidating to play
			- It will also inspire creativity as players will need to go back-to-basics and rely on core SF mechanics like crossovers
- The basic counter for a jump is a crouching high-punch, I should ensure the hitboxes mean that a jump attack is easier to dodge when crouched, while also being vulnerable
	- Just because you're crouched doesn't mean you can't hit an opponent that is higher than you
	
Playing to win: http://www.sirlin.net/ptw
- Deception: http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/1-deception
	- There's an effective range for each player
		- Anything that comes into the effective range can be dealt with with 'safe moves'
		- In order to break neutral games, non-safe moves must be made (footsies, taken from Fighting game Primer)
		- Effective ranges can differ by character or by player
	- Trap moves exist that allow the opponent to make moves specifically for you to counter
		- This puts the opponent in a worse position than not attacking, as they lift their block
		- This depends on the attack cooldowns and block-stun duration, and so I will test these scenarios when I have another player to test with
- The Attackers: http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/the-attackers
	- I double checked that it is possible to get close to the enemy and crouch, jump and block to stay in their personal space ('dancing') and stay aggressive
- The turtles: http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/the-turtles
	- It is important to get the hitboxes for each attack just right so that people can sit outside of opponents ranges
		- While chun-li vs chun-li means there's no attacks that are unique to one character, it still applies to people's mindsets
			- If one player likes to sweep and another likes to jump, their effective ranges will be different (from Deception)
	- I won't be implementing a timer into this game to lessen the turtling strategy
		- Chun-Li is a fast attacking offense character, and so she shouldn't turtle anyway
		- Turtling can be annoying to some players

From Chun-Li's move list (https://uk.ign.com/faqs/2006/playtv-legends-sega-genesis-street-fighter-ii-special-champion-edition-move-list-522302) I learned:
- Chun Li has 4 special moves: The Lightning kick, whirlwind kick, kikoken and spinning bird kick
	- I won't be implementing any of these as it will take a significant amount of work and knowledge to balance these moves with the rest of the moveset, not to mention to perform
	- Typically, these would be added after everything else is balanced perfectly 
- Chun Li is a fast character and performs well in the air
	- This is most likely due to the variety of moves available when she's in the air, in comparison to other characters
		- I've noticed that most characters have only a few moves, whereas Chun li has lots of kicks and forward-kicks in mid air
	- I need to make sure these moves are useful, ensuring they're easy to hit and good to combo with
	- I previously considered not implementing the wall jump, but now it has been implemented as it's important to her playstyle
	
From another Chun-Li move list (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588700-street-fighter-ii/faqs/64276) I learned:
	- She has a stomp attack that I couldn't perform in the emulator - wrong version of street fighter maybe?
		- I could actually perform it, it was stomp + medium kick, must have not tried it
		- This reinforces that chun-li has both a kicking playstyle and an arial one
		- Stomp kicks are hard to block as the direction to block depends on when the enemy uses it, this is a crossover
			- As states in 'fighting game primer', this attack requires the opponent to change their blocking direction as the player goes over them
- Damage appears to be universal, where it goes L-M-H punch and L-M-H kicks
	- While its definite that a heavy kick does more damage than a light one, how much more damage does a light kick do vs a punch?
		- In the emulator, the light punch (close range) does the same as a light puch from afar. Each attack will be hand tweaked
- Confirms that air kick

From "Fighting Game Primer" I learned:
- The attacks are light-medium-heavy, not low-middle-high. I was confused because chun-li's animations do correspond with low, middle and high, where the high attacks were the good ones.
	- In code, I'll keep it as low-high as that's not visible to the players.. but is technically incorrect
- You cannot attack, hit or block while you've been hitstunned. Luckily this is how I already interpreted it from the word 'stun'
- If hit when blocking, they get 'blockstunned', they can't stop blocking for a moment. They take no damage unless your attack is a special move (they'll take a little bit)
	- The blockstun shouldn't last too long, as the blocker needs to be able to attack during the attacker's wind down animation
	- Haven't figured out whether the block stun is a fixed duration or dependent on the move, although I have a feeling it's a fixed amount of time
	- It can't be short either: Blocking smaller hits allows the attacker to take advantage of the block stun by forcing them to block more moves that inflict chip damage
		- This means that blocking a harmless attack might lead to being forced (stunned) into blocking attacks that actually damage you - you cannot 'turn off' the block while stunned
- The duration of hitstuns determine whether they can start a combo - a large hitstun allows you to use a slower-wind up attack after
	- The high-kicks of Chun-li have quite a bit of windup (especially the neck-breaker), so these moves should be set up by hitting the opponent first to stun them
- When knocked down, the enemy has time to jump over the player and prepare an attack as they wake up
- Typically, Crouching attacks must be blocked low and Jumping attacks need to be blocked high, others can be blocked by either
- Sweeping (crouch-heavy-kick) causes knockdowns (as noted from when I emulated Street fighter, although now I know its HEAVY not high), and is very important in neutral game
	- With the widest reach, you can hit someone before they sweep and hit you, and they can't attack with a faster move thanks to the reach
	- When the game starts / is neutral, sweeping at the opponent is the 'correct' way to start an exchange
		- Footsies is the term given to trying to get into the enemy range to sweep without them sweeping you first
		- I need to ensure that the sweeps hitbox reflects this accurately with an appropriate knockdown duration
- I'm not implementing combos or throws
	- Throws can be interrupted by attacking or throwing yourself, but because chun-li is mainly a kicker, she isn't much of a thrower
		- She would typically throw when the enemy gets close to her to create distance, but Chun-Li vs Chun-Li wouldn't get much from this
	- Combos are difficult to time and execute and require fighting-game players to practice over and over again
	
From 'Street Fighter Footsies handbook' (https://sonichurricane.com/?page_id=1702): 
- Chapter 1:
	- Footsies comes from shuffling forwards and backwards into the enemy's attack range and not necessarily attacking
		- I made sure the move speed set in this game allows for quick forwards-backwards movement
	- After poking at them through footsies, the opponent's natural reactions change
		- This makes basic moves a lot more common than special attacks, which is why I haven't put in any special abilties
		- Also means that these moves need to be perfectly balanced
- Chapter 2:
	- Attacking just outside the opponent's effective range is just as important as actually hitting them
		- This makes the opponent try to sweep, only to be locked into the animation as your fast moves (chun-li's light-kicks) finish
		- This method of creating opportunities appears to be a gigantic portion of how to actually fight, as it determines who's on the attack and defense
			- After this point, only blocking and counter-attacking can change the momentum and so it's crucial that blocking is implemented
			- Chun Li is also a fast character, so wall-jumping is important to give the player multiple options of avoiding getting cornered and attacked
				- Her wall jump also makes her more unpredictable and is a useful tool
- Chapter 6:
	- Simply stepping forward can be used to mindgame your opponent into what kind of attack you're going to do
		- I won't be putting throws into the game, and so these tactics are less significant
		- However, Chun Li attacks from the air, and so maybe there is potential to try and bait which direction you're going to jump?
- Chapter 8:
	- This guide indicates that some characters have a height-requirement for jump attacks, but Chun-Li doesn't from experience with the emulator
	- This reinforces Chun Li as an arial character. you don't necessarily need to attack your opponent from above as you can hit with the jump attack from up close
- Chapter 9:
	- The effects of knockdowns also contain an anti-air element. The enemy can't block from above if they're knocked down, and it'll be too late 
		- I made sure that it was possible to sweep the enemy down and then jump attack as they're getting up for a free hit and as a combo start
